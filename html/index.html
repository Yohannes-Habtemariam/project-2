        <h2>Why Investment</h2>
        <p>
            Most of the people concentrate on earning an income through getting a higher-paying job and also working on some extra hours to earn more on top of their salary. However, there is limited hours and energy for a person to work the entire day. Consequently, there is lack of satisfaction which exposes a person to distress due to lack of leisure time for personal, family, friends, and society in general. The best solution to resolve such problem is to save part of your income into your saving account and investing it into lucrative businesses to maximize the earning potential by generating more profit all the time, because your money works for you all the time without the limitation of time and energy. Remember that money can never sleep, but you do. This happens only through investment. Investment is the act of committing capital to an endeavor with the expectation of gaining a profit. In other words, investing is just putting your money to work for you to gain an additional income.

        <h2>How to Invest</h2>
        <p>
            You have the opportunities to invest in stocks, bonds, FOREX, crypto, and real estate. 
            Furthermore, knowing how much to invest in each portfolio determines your success. David Swensen suggested how the asset allocation should be to generate sustainable profit in securities investment. His suggestion was to invest 30% in domestic equity, 15% in international equity, 10% in the emerging market equity, 15% in U.S. treasuries bonds, 15% in inflation protected bonds, and 15% in real estate. In addition, it is paramount important to invest in crypto and FOREX. It is obvious that the different securities perform differently at any point in time,
            therefore, the entire portfolio minimize risks and maximize revenues. Investors proved that if
            you spread your investments across various types of assets and markets, you will reduce the risk
            of catastrophic financial losses. This demonstrates that you must not put all your eggs in one
            basket.
